# Chrome Clock Extension

Hi,this is the first extension i've ever made so this is obviously very simpleðŸ˜…
it's a basic clock extension, i hope you know what it does hehe
# How to install

Download all these files and put them in a specific folder named anything of your choice,
Then open Chrome browser and type the url chrome://extensions on the search bar, it should open your extensions area.

At the top-right corner on the page you would see a toggle button labeled with developer mode. Turn that ON
Then you would see some more options poping out such as ["Load Unpacked","Pack extensions","Update"]

Right now we have to deal with just Load Unpacked, so click on that it will open the file explorer and then choose the folder where you kept all the
files.

Then the folder shall appear on the extensions list, turn it on by the toggle button and TA-DA the icon of a clock shall appear beside your search bar,
Click on it to show the time hehe.
